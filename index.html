			<p>Welcome to my Basic Portfolio. I was born on October 3rd, 1996 in Newport Beach, California. Since then, I've moved to Germany, lived in Massachusetts, and attended highschool at Proctor Academy in Andover, New Hampshire. Currently, I study at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota for a degree in Computer Science. Meanwhile, I decided to take a gap year in order to receive an education on full stack web development, a field that Macalester doesn't really cover, through which I hope to develop useful skills that will aid me in my career. My goal is to become a game designer/artist.</p>
			<p>I have a variety of hobbies. I like to play instruments, and have a background in piano, violin, guitar, and drums. I mostly find myself drawing and working out (since I play football for Macalester). Some of my passions are seasonal, like fly fishing. I've traveled the world a good amount, and hope to keep being able to do so. After I graduate from Mac, I plan on going back to the West Coast to seek job opportunities there, or continue my education in a different aspect, probably looking for art schools.</p>
